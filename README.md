# Weather-Web-App

**Project Description**

The Weather Web App is a lightweight client-side application that provides real-time weather updates for any city in the world. Users can input a city name to retrieve current weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The application uses a third-party Weather API to fetch accurate and up-to-date information. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app features a clean, responsive UI that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

* UI/UX: Built an intuitive interface for entering city names and displaying weather information.
* API Integration: Utilized a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live data based on user input.
* Error Handling: Validates city input and displays user-friendly error messages for invalid entries or API failures.
